## Lab-5 Tasks:

### Q #01:
Design a traffic light system. Ask the user to enter a color (Red, Yellow, Green) and use nested ifelse statements to display the corresponding action:
• Red: Stop
• Yellow: Caution
• Green: Go

### Q #02:
Write a program that asks for a movie rating (1 to 5) for movie “The Lion King” from user and
provides feedback based on the rating:
• 5: Excellent
• 4: Good
• 3: Average
• 2: Poor
• 1: Terrible

### Q #03:
Write a program that not only assigns a letter grade based on a score (0-100) but also gives
feedback based on the grade. Use nested if else.
• A: "Outstanding!"
• B: "Well done!"
• C: "You passed."
• D: "You need to improve."
• F: "Better luck next time."

### Q #04:
Write a program that categorizes a person's age into different life stages: Child, Teenager, Adult,
and Senior, using nested if-else statements.

### Q #05:
Create a program that determines if a number is positive, negative, or zero, and if it’s positive,
checks if it’s an even or odd number.

### Q #06:
Write a program that checks if a user can withdraw money from an ATM. Set a maximum
withdrawal limit (e.g., $500). If the amount requested is less than or equal to the limit and is a
multiple of $20, print "Withdrawal approved." Otherwise, print "Withdrawal denied."

### Q #07:
Write a program that checks if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5 using logical operators.

### Q #08:
Write a program using a ternary operator to find the maximum of two numbers.

### Q #09:
Write a program that determines ticket pricing for an event based on age:
• Children (0-12): $5
• Teens (13-17): $10
• Adults (18-64): $20
• Seniors (65+): $15
Ask the user for their age and print the corresponding ticket price.

### Q #10:
Use the ternary operator to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.

### Q #11:
Write a program that checks if a year is a leap year using the modulus operator.

### Q #12:
Create a program that checks if a driver is speeding based on the speed limit and the driver’s
speed. If the driver exceeds the speed limit by 10 mph or more, print "Speeding." If they are
within 10 mph of the limit, print "Driving safely." Use the modulus operator to check if the
speed is a multiple of 5 for additional feedback.
